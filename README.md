# Ecommerce Sentiment Analysis Project 📊🛒

This is the submission for Task 2 of Future Interns.

## Project Overview 🚀

This project performs a simple **Sentiment Analysis** on e-commerce product reviews using Python. It classifies reviews as **positive** 😊, **negative** 😞, or **neutral** 😐 based on keyword matching.

The goal is to analyze customer sentiments from a sample dataset and visualize the results in a pie chart.
